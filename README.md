### I'm Lizzie (she/her), a linguist-turned-coder 👋

I'm currently undertaking a bootcamp with Makers, learning Python, SQL and Java.

Before that I worked in the low-code world of Pega, first as a Pega Apprentice and then as a Pega Developer, passing my Pega System Architect exam in April 2025.

My first forway into coding was Codecademy's Front-End Engineering path, completing several projects as I learnt. Check them out! That course is what helped me realise I wanted to work in tech full-time.

My background is in the languages industry, with experience as a teaching assistant, translation project manager and self-employed translator, so I have great skills in communication, teamwork and problem-solving that I'm able to apply to my coding projects and work.
