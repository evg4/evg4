### I'm Lizzie (she/her), a linguist-turned-coder ðŸ‘‹

Since February 2024 I've been working as a Pega Apprentice. This is my first role in tech and I'm learning the low-code Pega platform, so I'm a little quiet here on GitHub while I get to grips with that.

Before landing my job, I completed Codecademy's Front-End Engineering path, completing several projects as I learnt. Check them out!

My background is in the languages industry, with experience as a teaching assistant, translation project manager and self-employed translator, so I have great skills in communication, teamwork and problem-solving that I'm able to apply to my coding projects and work.
