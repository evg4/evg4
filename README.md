### I'm Lizzie (she/her), a linguist-turned-coder ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Certified Pega System Architect and have been been working in the world of Pega since February 2024, first as a Pega Apprentice and now as a Pega Developer. 

Before landing my job, I completed Codecademy's Front-End Engineering path, completing several projects as I learnt. Check them out! I'm now learning Back-End, too, alongside strengthening my Pega skills.

My background is in the languages industry, with experience as a teaching assistant, translation project manager and self-employed translator, so I have great skills in communication, teamwork and problem-solving that I'm able to apply to my coding projects and work.
